Temporal programming makes it possible to express explicitly how an
interactive program behaves over time. Type membership is
time-dependent, and constructs for describing continuously changing
values, discrete events, and combinations thereof are provided. Temporal
programming can be seen as a form of functional reactive programming
(FRP), one that follows closely the originaly ideas behind FRP.

Pomelo is a library for temporal programming with a clean semantics and
an efficient implementation. It features a funtional approach to I/O
that integrates smoothly into the temporal setting.
