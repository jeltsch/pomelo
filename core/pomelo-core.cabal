synopsis:      Temporal programming, core constructs
description:   Temporal programming makes it possible to express explicitly how
               an interactive program behaves over time. Type membership is
               time-dependent, and constructs for describing continuously
               changing values, discrete events, and combinations thereof are
               provided. Temporal programming can be seen as a form of
               functional reactive programming (FRP), one that follows closely
               the originaly ideas behind FRP.
               .
               Pomelo is a library for temporal programming with a clean
               semantics and an efficient implementation. It features a
               funtional approach to I/O that integrates smoothly into the
               temporal setting.
               .
               This package provides the core constructs of Pomelo.
